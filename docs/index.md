Welcome to Train

RemObjects Train is a JavaScript based build engine for build automation and other scripting tasks.

You write your scripts as JavaScript code (we recommend to the `.train` file extension, but they are plain `.js` files), with access to all common JavaScript APIs, and a handful of powerful additional [APIs](API) that Train adds, targeted at common scripting tasks. You can then run these scripts using the `Train.exe` engine, on Windows, Mac and Linux.

Train is fully open source under the BSD license, written in [Oxygene](http://www.elementscompiler.com/oxygene) and build upon our (also open source) [Script for .NET](http://www.remobjects.com/script) JavaScrip/ECMAScript engine as runtime.

We hope you find Train useful. Please direct any feedback, suggestions or discussions to our [support forum](http://talk.remobjects.com/c/train) on RemObjects Talk.

You can find Train on GitHub at [github.com/remobjects/train](https://www.github.com/remobjects/train). Contributions and Pull Requests are appreciated!
